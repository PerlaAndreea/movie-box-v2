# Movie Box
## Movie Rating & Review App
I built a movie rating and review application with users, movies, reviews using ruby on rails and gem files such as simple_form, devise, paperclip and bootstrap.

For the development environment I used AWS Cloud9.

The application has a restful API with get and post routes for creating, editing and viewing movies and reviews.
